**Cowrie SSH Honeypot**
This project is part of my MSc Cybersecurity practical learning. I set up a Cowrie SSH honeypot to simulate unauthorized access attempts and study attacker behavior in a controlled environment. The honeypot captures login attempts, commands executed by attackers, and interactions with a fake filesystem, which I then analyze to understand attack patterns and intrusion techniques.

**🎯 Objective**
My goal with this project was to gain hands-on experience in intrusion detection, network monitoring, and log analysis, while developing a deeper understanding of attacker tactics and defensive strategies.

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

Python – for automation and log analysis
Cowrie SSH/Telnet Honeypot – for simulating attacks
Ubuntu Server / VirtualBox – for deployment and lab setup
Basic Networking Tools – for monitoring connections

**📊 Learning Outcomes**
Through this project, I learned:

How SSH honeypots capture malicious activity and attacker commands
How to analyze logs to identify attack patterns and potential threats
How to strengthen defensive awareness and anticipate attacks in real systems
How to implement basic automation using Python to process security data

**🚀 Future Enhancements**

Integrate ELK Stack for visualizing attack data
Add real-time alerting for suspicious activity
Apply machine learning techniques for anomaly detection and predictive analytics

**📁 Project Status**

This is an ongoing project, continuously improved as I expand my skills in security analytics and automation.
