# Cowrie SSH Honeypot

This project sets up a **Cowrie SSH honeypot** to simulate unauthorized access attempts and study attacker behavior.  
It captures login attempts, command activity, and system interactions for analysis.

## 🎯 Objective
To understand intrusion detection, network monitoring, and log analysis in a controlled cybersecurity lab setup.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Cowrie (SSH/Telnet Honeypot)  
- VirtualBox / Ubuntu Server  
- Basic networking tools

## 📊 What I Learned
- How honeypots capture malicious SSH activity  
- Logging and analyzing attack patterns  
- Strengthening defensive awareness in real systems

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate with ELK Stack for data visualization  
- Add alerting for real-time monitoring  
- Automate data analysis with Python scripts
